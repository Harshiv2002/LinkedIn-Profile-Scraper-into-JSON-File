# LinkedIn-Profile-Scraper-into-JSON-File

## Project Description:

This project Scrapes data from LinkedIn and stores the data in JSON file format for future use in data analytics.
The code automatically scrapes the linkedIn page given the URL, but only the URL should be inputted manually.

The scraper will be able to scrape-

1. Name üïµ
2. Job Description üè¢

There is no need to set up a virtual environment. Code is 100% done on jupyter notebook, easy implementation. 

## How to run the project:

Step 1- Collect all the URLs and put it in a list categorically, for example data scientists URLs has been put in one list
simillarly CEO URLs are put in another list and so on

Step 2- Install Dependencies 

Step 3- Run the *log into account* code block

Step 4- Run the *Scroll* function block, set the scrolling speed as per your internet speed

Step 5- Run the *Scrape* function

Step 6- If all the functions have successfully run proceed to run the *URL* Lists block and then Run the *main function* code block

Step 7- Enter the JSON file name and wait till the webscraping is complete, JSON file will be automatically created and downloaded  

Future improvements on this project may include adding a web crawler to input the URL making this project completely automatic, 
making collection of data even faster and efficient.
